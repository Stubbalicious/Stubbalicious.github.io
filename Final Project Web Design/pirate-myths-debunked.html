  <h1>Common Myths About Pirates</h1>
      <p>People have heard a lot of things about pirates throughout the years. Here are some of the most common myths.</p>
<section id=myths>
    <h2>They had an accent</h2>
      <p>Sadly, "arghh" wasn't a universal phrase used by pirates everywhere. The pirate accent was created by Hollywood to make them more unique.</p>
    <h2>Pirates had their own towns</h2>
      <p>There are no records of pirate settlements. Pirates were violent by nature so putting them all in one place was not a good idea. When they had to perform repairs on their ships they had to hide in lagoons or try to do them in the middle of the ocean.</p>
    <h2>Eye patches were used to cover injuries</h2>
      <p>If someone lost an eye on a pirate ship chances were they were going to die of an infection. Pirates kept an eye patch on so that they could always have one eye adjusted to the dark. This was useful when they went below deck in ships.</p>
    <h2>Pirates were mostly looking for gold</h2>
      <p>Gold was not the only thing valuable to pirates. Pirates would also take slaves, tobacco, sugar, indigo, and food. Items like food and water were especially important to pirates, because they couldn't stop at docks to restock so they needed to loot them from other boats to survive.</p>
    <h2>Pirates listened to no governments</h2>
      <p>The most successful pirates were actually privateers financed by a country. This gave them places they could dock and was a cheap way for a country to have a naval presence.</p>
    <h2>The crossbones was the universal pirate flag</h2>
      <p>There were many types of pirate flags. They came in all sorts of colors and had many designs other than a skull and crossbones.</p>
    <h2>Pirates buried their treasure</h2>
      <p>This was an idea popularized in novels about pirates. There have been no instances of people finding a buried treasure.</p>
