    <h1>Reality of Piracy</h1>
      <p>Pirates have always had an air of mystery around them. They have acquired an almost mythological status through out the years. There aren’t many written accounts of pirates so it was natural for people to start exaggerating things about them.</p>
      <p>A life of piracy was anything but glamourous. They were not off and singing chantys on the sea. Instead they had to battle diseases, the elements, and being hunted by other ships. It was not a job that people aspired to have it was a last resort. It was a job for convicts and people who were shunned by society. In fact many pirates were just captured crew ships they conquered; they were given the option to become a pirate or die.</p>
      <p class="pull-quote"> Pirates were basically the equivalent of ISIS on the sea.</p>
      <p>They were forced to live in tight quarters and darkness for months at a time. Pirates were keen on keeping big crews to intimidate ships, but it led to some truly awful living conditions. Coupled with the fact that most of these pirates were a little less stable than the average person it was a recipe for violence.</p>
      <p>Pirates could not build the ideal ship; they were scavengers. They could only take the ships that they conquered. Since they were criminals and what not, they couldn’t just stop at any dock and put in order for a new ship or repairs. They just had to take what they could get.</p>
      <p>They also weren’t known for saving damsels in distress. They had more of reputation for rape and torture. </p>
      <p>Piracy was not nearly as romantic as I grew up thinking it was. They didn’t have the goofy shenanigans of Captain Hook or the charisma of Captain Jack Sparrow. Pirates were basically the equivalent of ISIS on the sea. They raped, pillaged, and brought fear to people for two centuries until governments and technology caught up and put an end to the age of piracy.</p>
